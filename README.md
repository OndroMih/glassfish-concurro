# Jakarta EE Concurrency Compatible Implementation

Jakarta EE Concurrency provides a simple, standardized API for using concurrency from application components without compromising container integrity while still preserving the Jakarta EE platform's fundamental benefits.

This repository provides the implementation of the Jakarta Concurrency API that is used within Eclipse GlassFish. 

The EE4J repository that defines the api is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/concurrency-api).

This project is part of the overall Jakarta EE platform and is a project within the Eclipse EE4J Project. Please see the [Eclipse EE4J Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j) for details of the Top Level project.

We have a [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/cu-dev) for discussions.
We have a [Jenkins Instance](https://jenkins.eclipse.org/cu/) set up for building and testing.
